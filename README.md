- 👋 Hi, I’m @jemrie06, Jems, Jordan Emrie
- 👀 I’m interested in all things game and simulation development, interesting and unique gameplay, adding production value and an eye for fun and detail
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning-
        C++, C#, JavaScript,
        Unreal and Unity,
        augmented and virtual reality software development,
        fiction writing,
        producing, directing, and leading
